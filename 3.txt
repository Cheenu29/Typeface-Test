Design of DataStore:
Assuming each req/res takes 128KB
Now as given 100 APIs and 1000 Users with roughly 1000000 API requests

> Analysis

Users/API = 10 u/A
req/user = 1000 r/u

#load we are defining the size taken by the particular entity [assumption taken earlier] 
now load/user = 128*1000 KB

Total_Load = 128*10^6 KB per day

Now let say we are keeping monitoring data for 1 month [datastore capacity]: 
SO that would be around >> 128*10^6*30 KB (3.57 TB approx..)

Assuming the HOT Data access is 20% which is basically cached:
3.57*0.2 = 714 GB [required cache]

Note: Using NoSql[Key-value pair] storage policy for cache

Component in consideration:
Load Balancer
Cache
DataBase

Responsibility:
Req will be farworded to Load Balancer which then check with the available cache storage and then check for a hit if not then the request will be farworded
to the main database and queried for the given parameters which then will be again stored according to the data locality.
